# Holy Lord Above All Thrones Ascending

Holy Lord above all thrones ascending  
Clothed in power, love, and grace  
Humbly we come and bow before You  
Falling in awe before Your face

Holy Lord what precious love revealing  
Your Son came to live and die  
To make atonement for our sins  
It is finished was His cry

Holy Lord with Your own blood now cleansing  
Wash away my sin, my guilt, its stain  
With love eâ€™erlasting look upon me  
And call me by Your precious name

Holy Lord with trembling heart appealing  
To Your grace in trials wide  
Your strength to face the foes assailing  
Hold me by Your precious side

Holy Lord in majesty abiding  
Dwelling in inapproachable light  
Give us now the pure assurance  
Let our faith become our sight

Holy Lord over all thrones reigning  
Through the endless years of time  
Cause our joys to know no ending  
Trust in You with hope sublime
