# I Know That My Redeemer Lives

Job 19:25â€“27 For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth. And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God, whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. My heart faints within me!

I know that my Redeemer lives  
He bore the curse reserved for me  
He bled and died yet rose again  
King Eternal, Jesus He

I know that my Redeemer lives  
And He shall stand on earth again  
Enthroned here in righteousness  
King of all and Judge of men

I know that my Redeemer lives  
Though in the grave yet I may be  
When He comes with trumpet sound  
In my flesh He I will see

I know that my Redeemer lives  
My own eyes shall Him behold  
Oh for that day my heart does yearn  
The coming of my King foretold
