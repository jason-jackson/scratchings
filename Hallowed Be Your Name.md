# Hallowed Be Your Name

Matthew 6:9-10 Pray, then, in this way: 'Our Father who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.'

May every tongue confess the glory of our God  
May every nation bow in wonder, give Him laud  
May His kingdom fill the earth, may every nation praise  
Worship the King above, may the people stand amazed

> Let Your glory be over all the earth  
> Hallowed be Your name, let Your kingdom come  
> Hallowed be Your name, let your will be done

Glory to God in the highest angels sang at your birth  
All glory to Your name on heaven and earth  
Christ the Lord the victor over sin, death, and pain  
You did not despise the shame, for the crown You would gain

Let the mountains shake and tremble at Your word  
Let the nations bow; worship and extol the Lord  
Let the people rise and see all that You have wrought  
Let Your glory fill the earth, let us worship as we aught
