# Oh Bethlehem

Oh Bethlehem, have you not heard
The Savior came, the Holy Word
And brought to us the peace of God
To those His favor rests

Oh Bethlehem, have you not seen
A light has dawned, the coming King
Is born today, come join the praise
Of angels advent song

Oh Bethlehem, come and behold
The Lamb of God enter His fold
Come and receive you who believe
The precious gift of God
