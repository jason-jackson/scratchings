# Oh Bethlehem

Oh Bethlehem, have you not heard  
The Savior came, the Holy Word  
And brought to us the peace of God  
To those His favor rests

Oh Bethlehem, have you not seen  
A light has dawned, the coming King  
Is born today, come join the praise  
Of angels advent song

Oh Bethlehem, come and behold  
The Lamb of God enter His fold  
Come and receive you who believe  
The precious gift of God

Oh Bethlehem, taste now and see  
The Bread of Life, priceless and free  
Go where Heâ€™s trod, feed on your God  
And never want again

Oh Bethlehem, come and rejoice  
Give to your God, with heart and voice  
A song of praise, His anthem raise  
And worship Him on high
