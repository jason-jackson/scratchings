# What God has wrought

Content I be to let His glory shine  
As He performs righteous works not mine  
My greatest deeds like flowers in the field  
Passing, fleeting, so I will only yield  
Unto His Spirit working now in me  
Until heaven perfected for eternity

What God has wrought  
What God has wrought  
What glories shall I claim?  
Evermore and always  
Sing the praises of His name
