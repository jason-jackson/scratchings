# If I am so Bold

Hebrews 4:16 Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

If I am so bold, that I approach Your throne
If I am so bold, that You call me Your own
If I am so bold, that all the world has to offer
I now forsake to know You alone

If I am so bold, let me call You Father
If I am so bold, let me bow in wonder
If I am so bold, let me stand against the world
Why should I fear any other

If I am so bold, You are my confidence
If I am so bold, You are my Savior
If I am so bold, You are my strength to stand
Alone for You my God
