# Jesus is Alive

See the women weeping wailing
See the angel calmly sitting
See the tomb where they did lay Him
Know that death in vain has kept Him
Jesus is alive, Jesus is alive

See the disciples lost in sorrow
See the sheep without a shepherd
See the sun now swiftly rising
Know that no grave now can hold Him
Jesus is alive, Jesus is alive

See Peter, John now racing
To the grave which once contained Him
Marvel at the tomb now empty
Yet still shrouded by confusion
Jesus is alive, Jesus is alive

See Jesus calmly eating
The food the disciples gave Him.
Speaking, Phillip who was doubting
Feel my hands and feel my side.
Jesus is alive, Jesus is alive
