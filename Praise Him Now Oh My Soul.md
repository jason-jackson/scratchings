# Praise Him Now Oh My Soul

Oh my soul praise the High King of heaven
Sing His praises now evermore
For He lifts my life up to highest heaven
Praise Him now, oh my soul, come adore

Oh my soul praise the Lord most High
And to His feet your tribute bring
A sacrifice to our God Adonai
Praise Him now, oh my soul, come and sing

Oh my soul praise the Lamb of God
Who with His blood has purchased me
To Him be the greatest laud
Praise Him now, oh my soul, come be free

Oh my soul praise the Spirit most holy
Let us now His sanctification receive
Transformed from glory into glory
Praise Him now, oh my soul, come believe

Oh my soul praise the Father Eternal
Reigning evermore on high
Ineffably supreme, only Sovereign
Praise Him now, oh my soul, hear my cry
