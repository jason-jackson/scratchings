# Just a Child

Just a child — humble, lowly,
I retreat into Your Word.
There I find so rich a treasure,
You are life indeed.

Just a child — battered, beaten,
By the storms of life assailed.
Come and carry me dear Father,
Home is beckoning.

Just a child — wayward, weary,
By the guilt of sin ensnared.
In Your love, You come restore me,
Lead me in the truth.

Just a child — laughing, loving,
Eyes see only You.
Dance in joy and wonder,
Forever home with You.
