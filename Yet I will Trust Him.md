# Yet I will Trust Him

Job 13:15-16 Though He slay me, I will hope in Him; yet I will argue my ways to His face. This will be my salvation, that the godless shall not come before Him.

Though He may slay me, yet I will trust Him
For His ways are best indeed
He has become my salvation
And He alone is all I need

Though trials may come, yet I will trust Him
For He has my best in mind
My tears which flow, cause me to know
The greater joy when heaven I find

Though all goes well, yet I will trust Him
Tarrying not, nor gone ahead
Till life is done, and heaven is won
And Christ and I are wed
