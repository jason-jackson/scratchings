# Blessed Be the Father of Our Lord

1 Peter 1:3-7 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, having been kept in heaven for you, who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

Blessed be the Lord God our Father  
Blessed be the Father of our Lord  
By Your mercy we’re begotten  
through His death and resurrection  
Born again to living hope  
To inheritance undefiled and unfading  
Kept in heaven by the Son of the King  
By faith we’re protected in Your power  
For salvation that is yet to be seen  
We rejoice and magnify You while we suffer  
For our trials refine our faith in You  
More precious than gold is the faith that we hold  
To the glory and honor of Jesus  
All glory and honor to You
