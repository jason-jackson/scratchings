# Of Beauty Fleeting

Of beauty fleeting as a shadow,  
Wrought by candle flickering,  
To and fro tossed by the moment.  
Whither is peace, would it not stay,  
The stillness unnerves me unseemingly.  
And each breath a vision of yesterday,  
Till at last: smoke, darkness, cold —  
Death, no more shadow dancing.

Where then is hope, it would not do,  
To flicker and dance past the moon —  
Of quiet, of quarrels, of gray.  
But hope is not gone with the candle’s song  
For after the night is day.
